   - Open TillSave app
   - Click "Create Account"
   - Enter your phone number
   - Verify the OTP (One-Time Password) sent to your phone

3. **Share the Code**

   - Members join using: Menu → "Join Group" → Enter code

**Tip**: Write down your code and keep it safe. Members need it to join.

---

### Q2: How do I add members to my group?

**A**: Members add themselves:

1. **Members Use the Code**
   - Share your 6-digit group code with members
   - They open TillSave
   - Go to Menu → "Join Group"
   - Enter your code
   - They're automatically added

---

## Recording Payments

### Q4: How do I record a payment when a member gives me money?

1. **Open Your Group**
   - Select your group from dashboard
   - Click "Record Payment" button

2. **Enter Payment Details**
   - **Member Name**: Select from dropdown

   - **Currency**: Choose RWF, USD, EUR, etc.
   - **Date**: Automatically today (can change if needed)
   - **Note**: Optional (e.g., "Cash from METERO")

3. **Confirm**

   - Click "Record Payment"
   - ✅ Payment saved! Members see it instantly

**Tip**: Record payments daily or after you receive them. This keeps records accurate.

> For detailed guide, see [02-ORGANIZER_CHECKLIST.md](02-ORGANIZER_CHECKLIST.md) - Week 1-2

---

### Q5: What if I recorded a payment by mistake?

**A**: 
- **Currently**: We can't delete payments yet (for security)
- **Solution**: Contact us with:
  - Which member
  - Date and amount
  - We'll help you fix it

**Coming Soon**: We're adding an "Edit Payment" feature in January.

---

### Q6: Can members record their own payments?

**A**: 
**No**, only you (organizer) record payments because:
- You handle the money in person
- Members might make mistakes
- One source of truth = no confusion
- You have full control and transparency

**Members can**:
- View their payment history
- See their total saved
- Check when they last paid
- But they can't add payments

---

## Understanding Your Dashboard

### Q7: What do the numbers on my dashboard mean?

**A**: Your dashboard shows:

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Total Saved** | All money collected this cycle from all members |
| **Members** | How many people are in your group |
| **Days Active** | How many days the current cycle has been running |
| **Your Earnings** | Your commission (1 day of contribution per member) |

**Example**:
- 5 members, each saved 5,000 RWF for 30 days = 750,000 total
- Your earnings = 5,000 × 5 members = 25,000 RWF

---

### Q8: What happens when I close a cycle and finalize payouts?

**A**: This is important! Here's the complete flow:

**Before You Click "Finalize"**:
1. Review the payout breakdown
   - See how much each member gets
   - See your commission
   - See total money to distribute

2. **Confirmation Modal Appears** (New!)
   - Review all amounts one more time
   - Check member names
   - Verify total
   - Click "Cancel" if something is wrong
   - Click "Confirm" to proceed

3. **Payout Is Finalized**
   - ✅ All payments locked in system
   - ✅ Record created in TillSave
   - ✅ Report generated for your records
   - ✅ You can print/save as PDF

4. **Cycle Complete Screen**
   - 🎉 Celebration screen shows
   - See cycle summary
   - Two options:
     - **"Start Cycle 2"** → Next cycle begins immediately
     - **"View Report"** → See detailed breakdown

5. **Start Next Cycle**
   - Click "Start Cycle 2" (or next number)
   - Dates reset to today
   - Members can contribute to new cycle immediately
   - Process repeats

**Example Timeline**:
```
Cycle 1: Dec 1 - Dec 30
↓ (Dec 30: Finalize Payout)
↓ (Dec 30: Start Cycle 2)
Cycle 2: Dec 31 - Jan 29
↓ (Jan 29: Finalize Payout)
↓ (Jan 29: Start Cycle 3)
Cycle 3: Jan 30 - Feb 28
```

## Payouts & Money

### Q9: How is my commission calculated?

**A**: You earn **1 day's contribution per member**

**Formula**:
```
Your Commission = Member's Daily Rate × Number of Members

Example:
- 5 members
- Each member contributes 5,000 RWF/day
- Your commission = 5,000 × 5 = 25,000 RWF per cycle
```

**Why?**
- You spend time managing the group
- You handle money and trust
- You organize payouts
- Your commission is fair compensation

**Member Gets**:
```
Member Payout = (Total Saved) - (Your Commission)

Example:
- Member saved 150,000 RWF
- Your commission is 5,000 RWF (1 day)
- Member gets: 150,000 - 5,000 = 145,000 RWF
```

---

### Q10: Can I change my commission rate?

**A**: 
- **Currently**: Commission is fixed at 1 day per member
- **Why**: Keeps it simple and fair
- **Coming in Phase 2**: You'll be able to set custom rates

**To adjust now**:
- Contact us with your proposed rate
- We'll help you recalculate for your members
- Get member approval before changing

---

### Q11: What if members don't contribute equally?

**A**: TillSave handles this automatically:

**Example Scenario**:
```
Group: 4 members, 30-day cycle

Member A: Contributes all 30 days → 150,000 RWF
Member B: Contributes 20 days → 100,000 RWF
Member C: Contributes 15 days → 75,000 RWF
Member D: Contributes 5 days → 25,000 RWF

Total Saved: 350,000 RWF
Your Commission (1 day each × 5,000): 20,000 RWF
Net to Distribute: 330,000 RWF

Payouts:
- Member A: 150,000 - 5,000 = 145,000 RWF
- Member B: 100,000 - 5,000 = 95,000 RWF
- Member C: 75,000 - 5,000 = 70,000 RWF
- Member D: 25,000 - 5,000 = 20,000 RWF

✅ Automatic calculation based on what they saved
✅ No manual math needed
```

---

### Q12: What if a member leaves mid-cycle?

**A**: They keep what they saved:

**Example**:
- Member was in for 15 days
- Saved 5,000 RWF/day = 75,000 total
- Cycle continues for other members
- When cycle ends, they get their 75,000 (minus commission)
- They're not in next cycle unless they rejoin

**To Handle**:
1. Stop recording their payments
2. At payout time, they still get their saved amount
3. They can rejoin in next cycle if they want

---

## Multi-Currency Support

### Q13: How do I handle multiple currencies?

**A**: TillSave tracks each currency separately:

**Recording Payments**:
1. Select member
2. Enter amount
3. **Choose currency**: RWF, USD, EUR, KES, etc.
4. Save

**Dashboard Shows**:
```
Total Saved:
- 2,500,000 RWF
- 1,500 USD
- 500 EUR

Your Earnings:
- 150,000 RWF
- 100 USD
- 30 EUR
```

**Payouts Are Separate**:
- Member A gets 150,000 RWF + 100 USD
- Member B gets 180,000 RWF only
- Each member gets back what they contributed

**No Conversion**:
- We don't convert currencies
- Keep it simple: each member gets back their currency
- You handle exchange if needed offline

---

### Q14: What if members contribute in different places?

**A**: TillSave works for this:

**Example: Members abroad**:
- Member in Rwanda contributes in RWF
- Member in USA contributes in USD
- Member in UK contributes in GBP
- All tracked separately
- Each gets their own currency back

**On Payout**:
```
Member A (Rwanda):
- Saved: 500,000 RWF
- Gets: 495,000 RWF

Member B (USA):
- Saved: 300 USD
- Gets: 295 USD

Member C (UK):
- Saved: 200 GBP
- Gets: 195 GBP
```

**You Handle Transfer**:
- You move money to each member's location
- We track the accounting
- You're the money manager

## Reports & Records

### Q15: How do I keep records of payouts?

**A**: TillSave generates reports automatically:

1. System generates **Payout Report** (PDF)
2. Shows:
   - All member names and amounts
   - Your commission
   - Dates of cycle
   - Report ID for reference
