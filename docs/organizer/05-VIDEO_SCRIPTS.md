---

### SCRIPT

---

**[INTRO - 10 seconds]**

[Show phone home screen with TillSave app]

"Hi everyone, I'm [YOUR_NAME], your TillSave organizer. Today I'll show you the easiest part of our savings group: how to record your contribution. It's so simple, even my grandma can do it."

[Smile at camera]

---

**[DEMO - 2 minutes 30 seconds]**

[Open the app, show main dashboard]

"First, let me open the app and tap on 'Record Payment'."

[Tap the button - show it clearly]

"Here's the screen. It has three things: Your name, the amount, and the date."

[Point at each field]

"Let's say I'm contributing 5,000 RWF today. I tap on my name first..."

[Select your name from list]

"Then I enter 5,000 in the amount field..."

[Type slowly: 5,000]

"The date is automatically today, which is perfect. If you recorded yesterday, just change the date."

[Show date picker]

"Now I hit CONFIRM and... done!"

[Tap confirm, show success screen with animation]

"The app immediately shows my new total: I've contributed 35,000 RWF this month, and I have 3 members who also contributed."

[Point to dashboard stats]

"The app is calculating my payout automatically. You can see:
- How much I contributed
- How much the group collected
- How many days until the end of cycle
- My commission (in this case, 25,000 RWF, which is 5,000 per member)"

[Walk through each stat]

"That's it! Recording a payment is literally 10 seconds of your time."

---

**[CLOSING - 20 seconds]**

[Back to face camera]

"So remember:
1. Open the app
2. Tap 'Record Payment'
3. Enter your name and amount
4. Hit confirm
5. Watch your numbers grow!"

[Smile]

"If you have questions, just ask [YOUR_NAME]. We're here to help."

[End]

## VIDEO #2: "Understanding Your Payout Report" (3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Explaining the end-of-cycle breakdown  
**Target Audience**: All members, especially those asking "Where's my money?"  
**Recording Tips**: Show real report from your phone

---

### SCRIPT

---

**[INTRO - 15 seconds]**

[Show yourself speaking to camera]

"Hi, it's [YOUR_NAME] again. Today I want to show you something that confuses many people: the payout report. By the time you finish watching this 3-minute video, you'll understand exactly where every shilling goes."

[Tap phone to show app]

---

**[DEMO PART 1: The Big Picture - 1 minute]**

[Open the payout report in app - show full screen]

"Here's the end-of-cycle report. It has four main sections:"

[Point at first section]

"**1. CYCLE SUMMARY**: This shows the basic numbers.
- We had 5 members
- Cycle was 30 days
- Total collected: 750,000 RWF
- That's 150,000 per member on average"

[Let them read it]

"Notice the date range: December 1 to December 30. The app calculated everything for exactly 30 days."

---

**[DEMO PART 2: Member Breakdown - 1 minute]**

[Scroll to member details section]

"**2. MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS**: This shows what each person paid.

Let me break down John's row:
- John's name
- He contributed 6 times (days 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25)
- Total: 30,000 RWF
- Days contribution: 6 days
- His payout: 30,000 RWF (what he paid back)"

[Point clearly at each number]

"**3. MY COMMISSION** (your cut): 
- As organizer, I earned 5,000 RWF per member
- 5 members × 5,000 = 25,000 RWF commission
- This is fair because I:
  - Spent 5,000 RWF for group setup
  - Spent time managing
  - Handled questions and disputes"

[Pause for effect]

"Some people ask 'Why do you get extra?' Remember: You pay back exactly what you put in. My commission comes from the group's total, not from your pocket."

---

**[DEMO PART 3: The Math - 30 seconds]**

[Show math breakdown on screen]

"Here's the simple formula the app uses:

**Total Collected** = 750,000 RWF  
**Minus My Commission** = -25,000 RWF  
**Equals Member Payouts** = 725,000 RWF  
**Divided by 5 Members** = 145,000 per person

Everyone gets back what they paid in, plus their share of the pool. Simple."

---

**[CLOSING - 15 seconds]**

[Face to camera]

"So when you see the report:
- ✅ Check your contribution amount (correct?)
- ✅ Check your payout amount (matches your contribution)
- ✅ Check the commission (fair for your organizer's work)

Print this report and keep it for your records. You've got proof of everything."

[Smile]

"Questions? Ask [YOUR_NAME]. That's why I'm here."

[End]

---

### TIPS FOR RECORDING

- ✅ Use a REAL report from your group (not example data)
- ✅ Have pen/pointer ready to point at numbers
- ✅ Record in well-lit area
- ✅ Speak slowly - this is the "confusing" video
