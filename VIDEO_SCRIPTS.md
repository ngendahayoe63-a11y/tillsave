### Script

**[INTRO - 0:00]**

> "Hi! I'm [YOUR_NAME] from TillSave. 
> 
> This video shows you the most important thing you'll do every day: recording a payment.
> 
> Let's keep it simple. It takes 30 seconds."

**[OPEN APP - 0:15]**

> "First, open the TillSave app.
> 
> [Show phone screen]
> 
> Select your group - I'm going to select 'Monday Savings Circle'.
> 
> [Tap on group]
> 
> Now click the green 'Record Payment' button."

**[RECORD PAYMENT FORM - 0:30]**

> "The form appears. Here's what you need:
> 
> **First**: Select the member name from the dropdown. 
> [Tap dropdown, show options]
> I'm going to select 'METERO Aloys'.
> 
> **Second**: Type the amount they gave you.
> [Type amount: 5000]
> Let's say he gave me 5,000 RWF.
> 
> **Third**: Choose the currency.
> [Tap currency, show RWF/USD/EUR options]
> We're using RWF, so I select that.
> 
> **Fourth**: The date. It's automatically today, which is correct.
> If they paid you yesterday, you can change it.
> 
> **Fifth** (optional): Add a note. 
> Like 'Cash from METERO' or 'Mobile payment'. 
> This helps you remember if someone paid twice."

**[SAVE - 1:45]**

> "Now I click 'Record Payment'.
> 
> [Click button]
> 
> ✅ Done! The payment appears in the list immediately.
> 
> METERO's total saved now shows 5,000 RWF.
> 
> If I scroll down, I can see it in the payment history too."

**[DASHBOARD UPDATE - 2:00]**

> "Notice the dashboard updated automatically:
> - Total saved went up
> - METERO's name shows as contributed
> - Everything is live, everyone can see it
> 
> [Swipe to show dashboard changes]"

**[MULTIPLE CURRENCIES - 2:15]**

> "Quick note: If someone pays you in dollars or euros, just select that currency instead of RWF.
> 
> [Show currency dropdown again]
> 
> The app keeps track of each currency separately. No conversions needed - you handle that when you pay people back."

**[DAILY HABIT - 2:30]**

> "Best practice: Record payments daily.
> 
> Don't wait until end of cycle. 
> 
> Every time someone gives you money:
> 1. Open the app
> 2. Click Record Payment
> 3. Enter their name, amount, currency
> 4. Click Save
> 
> 30 seconds. Done."

**[OUTRO - 2:50]**

> "That's it! You now know how to record a payment.
> 
> Do this every day, and at the end of 30 days, 
> the app will calculate all the payouts automatically.
> 
> Questions? Check the FAQ or contact us.
> 
> Now go make your savings group successful! 💪"

**[END - 3:00]**

1. **Opening**: Show your face (build trust)
2. **Form filling**: Zoom into phone screen (so they see what they're tapping)
3. **Dashboard**: Show the real update (prove it works)

- If you mess up a word, just keep going
- Zoom in on phone screen when showing buttons/numbers
- Pause 2 seconds after each step for people to absorb
- Smile at beginning and end

## VIDEO 2: "Understanding Your Payout Report" (3 minutes)

**Goal**: Help organizers understand the final number and trust the math

**Equipment Needed**:
- Phone with TillSave app (or example printed report)
- Report document (printed or on screen)
- Ring light (optional)
- Quiet room

---

### Script

**[INTRO - 0:00]**

> "Hi! I'm [YOUR_NAME] from TillSave.
> 
> By the end of a 30-day cycle, you'll have a payout report.
> This video explains what all those numbers mean.
> 
> It's simpler than it looks."

**[SHOW REPORT - 0:15]**

> "Here's a sample report.
> 
> [Hold up printed report or show on screen]
> 
> It looks official because it IS official. 
> You'll use this to distribute money to members.
> 
> Let me break down each section."

**[SECTION 1: GROUP INFO - 0:30]**

> "Top of the report shows:
> 
> **Group Name**: This is your group.
> **Cycle Number**: We completed Cycle 1. Next we'll do Cycle 2, 3, etc.
> **Dates**: Shows when the cycle ran (Dec 1 - Dec 30)
> **Members**: How many people are in the group (4 in this example)
> 
> This is just for reference. You probably know all this already!"

**[SECTION 2: THE MONEY - 1:00]**

> "Now the important part - the money.
> 
> There are two big numbers at the top:
> 
> **TOTAL DISTRIBUTED**: 248,495 RWF
> This is how much money all members will get back.
> NOT including your commission.
> 
> **ORGANIZER EARNINGS**: 14,500 RWF
> This is your payment for managing the group.
> You earn 1 day per member = 5 members × 5,000 RWF = 25,000 RWF... 
> wait, that doesn't match?
> 
> [If needed, explain this is because members contributed different amounts]
> 
> The app calculated it perfectly. You don't need to understand the math - it's done for you."

**[SECTION 3: MEMBER TABLE - 1:45]**

> "Here's the main table with each member:
> 
> **Name**: The member's name
> **Days Paid**: How many days they contributed (some paid all 30, some paid 20)
> **Total Saved**: How much money they put in
> **Organizer Fee**: Your commission deducted (1 day's contribution)
> **Net Payout**: What they get back (Total Saved minus your fee)
> 
> Let me show you an example:
> 
> METERO paid for 14 days, saved 97,997 RWF.
> Your fee = 7,000 RWF (1 day of their contribution)
> He gets back: 97,997 - 7,000 = 90,997 RWF
> 
> It's automatic. You don't calculate. The app does."

**[VERIFY NUMBERS - 2:15]**

> "Here's how you verify it's correct:
> 
> **Before You Finalize**:
> 1. Count the cash in front of you
> 2. Compare to 'TOTAL DISTRIBUTED' in the app
> 3. Do the numbers match? Great!
> 4. Don't match? Check if you recorded all payments
> 
> **The Confirmation Modal** (this is new!)
> Before you finalize, the app shows you the breakdown one more time.
> You review everything and click Confirm.
> 
> This prevents mistakes."

**[SIGNATURE & DISTRIBUTION - 2:45]**

> "At the bottom is a signature line.
> When you hand over money to a member, they sign here.
> It proves they received it.
> 
> Keep this report:
> - Digital copy (photo or PDF)
> - Printed copy (filed safely)
> 
> It's your proof that you paid everyone correctly."

**[OUTRO - 2:55]**

> "That's a payout report!
> 
> Remember:
> ✅ The app does the math
> ✅ You review before finalizing
> ✅ Distribute based on the numbers
> ✅ Keep the report for records
> 
> You've got this! Questions? Check the FAQ."

**[END - 3:00]**
